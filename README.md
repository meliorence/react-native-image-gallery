A pure JavaScript image gallery component for React Native apps with common gestures like pan, pinch and doubleTap, supporting both iOS and Android.

This component aims to be the best image viewer for React Native apps, it is far more elegant than other gallery-like components as it features some of the most useful functionalities found in the iOS photo album app such as:

* Gesture handling - other than the common pan, pinch and doubleTap gestures, this component also performs efficiently when targeting focus point (also known as pivot) on zoom-in and zoom-out.
* Responder switch - the gesture responder switch is far more flexible than any other component, that is, the scrollable container and the wrapped image children perform well in acquiring and releasing gesture responder from/to each other.

This component utilizes **[@ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager)** as the scrollable container and **[react-native-transformable-image](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-transformable-image)** as the wrapped image. 

This component works on react-native **0.44+**.

You can try this example live in **Archriss' showcase app** on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.archriss.demo.app) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/archriss-presentation-mobile/id1180954376?mt=8) or check out the demo.

## Install

`npm install --save react-native-image-gallery` or `yarn add react-native-image-gallery`

## Usage example

```javascript
import Gallery from 'react-native-image-gallery';

  render() {
    return (
      <Gallery
        style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}
        images={[
          { source: require('yourApp/image.png'), dimensions: { width: 150, height: 150 } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/XP2BE7q.jpg' } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/5nltiUd.jpg' } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/6vOahbP.jpg' } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/kj5VXtG.jpg' } }
        ]}
      />
    );
  }
```

## Remote and local images

This component supports both remote images by specifying `source.uri`, and local images where `source` is the result of `require()`.

**Be aware that the width and height must be defined for local images, but is not required for remote images!** Although the dimensions could still be provided for remote images to save the gallery from fetching them, which could potentially improve performance.

## Scroll state and events

* `onPageScroll` : (event) => {}. 

  The event object carries following data: 

  * `position`:  index of first page from the left that is currently visible.
  * `offset`: value from range [0,1) describing stage between page transitions.
  * `fraction`: means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at "position" index is visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.

* `onPageScrollStateChanged` : (state) => {}.

  Called when the page scrolling state has changed. The page scrolling state can be in 3 states:

  * `'idle'`: there is no interaction with the page scroller happening at the time.
  * `'dragging'`: there is currently an interaction with the page scroller.
  * `'settling'`: there was an interaction with the page scroller, and the page scroller is now finishing its closing or opening animation.
